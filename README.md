# Data-driven heuristic algorithm to solve TSP with spatial structure and time window
It is the project we did for participating in the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge, supported by the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics. More information about the challenge can be found here https://routingchallenge.mit.edu/

The data set is provided by Amazon and MIT CTL and are not uploaded here because of their big size (exceeding limitation allowed in Github).
